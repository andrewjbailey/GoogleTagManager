# GoogleTagManager
A repository for code snippets for GTM

   identifySource.js - This snippet of code can be used in the GTM to create a cookie, the contents of which will persist a variable (defined within GTM) that can be used to define a traffic source parameter within a Tag.  This use case was used for Affiliate Window (a remarketing network) - please note the catch-all value is 'aw' but can be defined as 'no channel' or whatever is required.
